        The iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS.

        While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to
        let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make web applications for the
        Safari web browser. However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs
        announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February
        2008. The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.

        The SDK is a free download for users of Mac personal computers. It is not available for Microsoft Windows
        PCs. The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices, such
        as hardware and software attributes. It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the
        device on the computer while developing. New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS.
        In order to test applications, get technical support, and distribute apps through App Store, developers are
        required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.

        Combined with Xcode, the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming
        languages, including Swift and Objective-C. Other companies have also created tools that allow for the
        development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages.
